# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Dana build a dynamic webpage to display data about UFO sightings. To do this we were tasked with creating a table that held the information on UFO sightings, and a filter search box that would allow users to serch the data according to the date, city, state, country, and shape of a UFO sighting. 

## Results

Here we will walk through the webpage as well as demonstrate what a search on the webpage might look like. Below are two images that show what the webpage looks like before a search is completed.

On the left hand side of the page you will find the “Filter Search” box that we created to filter the data.

To use this box all you must do is type a similar query in any of the text boxes and then click anywhere on the screen and the data will filter accordingly. As you can see below, I have typed fl in the “Enter a City” search and the data is only showing UFO sightings from Florida now.

You can also add a second criteria to your search as seen below. I have added the date 1/11/2020 to the “Enter Date” search and now the webpage is only showing UFO sightings that happened in Florida on 1/11/2020.

You can keep adding criteria if you wish until all of the text boxes are full, and the website will only display the relevant UFO sightings.

## Summary

After creating this dynamic webpage and putting it to the test with many searches, there is one major drawback I see. The drawback is that the search filters are very ridged. For example, if you were to type out “Texas” in the “Enter a State” search you would get nothing displayed in the chart. 
I would recommend adding drop down bars for each of the search bars except the date search because it would be too long. That would allow users to know exactly what their options are and guarantee that something is returned in the chart when they search it. The second thing I would work on developing is an actual search button. This would allow users to know when to expect the chart to change as well as allow them to multiple criteria before the chart changed.
Even though the webpage is very dynamic and useful now I believe with those few changes it could make the webpage more user friendly and possibly get more people to use it.
